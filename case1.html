                A college project where we chose a non-profit cause, gathered user insights and then produced a webpage
                that would promote the cause to the target group. I chose to focus on the Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund and in particular their efforts to bring vaccines to the African continent.

                Impact / Effort matrix
            </h5>

            <p>
                While working on this project I also read various texts aimed at helping UX design students with the
                design challenges they will be given in job interviews. For this project i chose to follow <a href="https://productdesigninterview.com/" target="new">Artiom Dashinskyâ€™s</a>  recommendation of starting the
                exercise with a simple Impact / Effort analysis.
            </p>

        <div class="case1__survey-text" id="survey">

            <h5>
                Survey
            </h5>

            <p>
                The Impact / Effort matrix noted that reaching high net worth individuals would potentially bring in more 
                revenue to the cause, but as I was enrolled in college at the time and only had a few weeks to do the assignment, fellow students were my most readily
                available source for user insights. I therefore based the project on 20 - 30 year olds as the intended
                target audience.
                <br><br>
                I created a Google questionnaire with a view to capture their living situations, their news- and
                social media habits, their experiences with charitable giving and their attitudes to NGOs in
                general.
                With a view to get the tone right I took some cues from Sara Wachter-Boettchâ€™s book 'Technically Wrong',
                and added a final section of questions designed to get a feel for their experiences (and possible
                trauma) related to the pandemic.

                Affinity Mapping
            </h5>
            <p>
                In a Miro board I copied the survey responses onto post it notes. I then used one of my favourite UX
                tools, affinity mapping, and relatively quickly discovered a number of broader trends and attitudes.
                <br> <br>
                (I've blurred out the individual responses.)

        <div class="case1__personas-text" id="personas" class="js-scroll">

            <h5>
                Personas
            </h5>

            <p>
                In a separate workspace I copied the main affinity keywords from the mapping session onto a new set of
                post it notes. As I ordered and began to link these keywords together, three distinct attitudes began to
                emerge. These formed the cores of three personas who would go on to inform the subsequent work with the
                project.
                <br> <br>
                By inserting a middle layer of affinity mapping between the survey response and the personas, I now had
                personas that were one step removed from the questionnaire respondents. These reflected broader
                patterns in the target population, rather than being mere charicatures of whoever had initially grabbed
                my attention during the survey phase. This way I could lower the risk of an uncious bias in favour of the respondents who
                most closely resembled a â€˜preferredâ€™ user profile.

            <p>
                In the pen and paper phase I was mindful of the target audienceâ€™s preference for mobile phones, so the layouts were sketched with a view to create a single, scrolling-friendly landing page.
                I divided the images and information into clearly defined and geometrically delineated sections that
                could easily be stacked and re-organised depending on the screen size.

            <h5>
                Mid-fi Wireframes
            </h5>

            <p>
                The mid-fi wireframes were my first attempt at establishing a fundamental information architecture. But
                more importantly I used this as an opportunity to test three distinct aesthetic styles. Using Figma and Figma Mirror I
                sought responses to these in a series of user interviews with representatives of the target
                group.
                <br><br>
                Briefly explained, the first style attempted to represent the closest thematic link to the upbeat tone
                and saturated colours of social media, the medium through wich one would most likely promote the cause
                to
                the target audience. The second option was based on the warm rich tones often associated with an African
                aesthetic, without making it too obvious, and the strong typographic contrasts refelect the visual language
                of
                news media from where the target audience received their updates on the pandemic. The final (and
                least popular) style sought to reflect the fight against the pandemic as a medical and scientific
                endeavour.

                Photos
            </h5>

            <p>
                For all three themes I used Creative Commons licensed material from African photographers. I chose
                motifs featuring subjects in the same age bracket as the target audience, in relatable poses and
                fashionable clothes, thus carefully avoiding the many overused visual clichÃ©s from Africa that one
                typically sees in NGO marketing material. Editing them into grayscale was a pragmatic
                decision, so as to bring visual cohesion to photos taken by photographers who may have used widely different camera equipment and editing
                techinques.

            <p>
                Given the seriousness of the subject matter, my test users felt that the most sombre palette was the most
                appropriate for this project.
                <br><br>
                In the hi-fi wireframes I set out to sketch a mobile version, a tablet version as well as versions for
                laptop- and desktop screens.

                While somewhat stark, the high contrasts ensured that the palette delivered in terms of WCAG
                requirements.
                <br><br>
                Figmaâ€™s Able plugin gave AAA scores for all text and Chrome Lighthouse gave the final webpage a 95 score

                This project was my first chance to set up and implement various methods to get data once the site is up and running. I got visitor statistics with Google Analytics and heatmap recordings with Hotjar. A great way to continue to gather user data once the initial insight and testing phases are over.
