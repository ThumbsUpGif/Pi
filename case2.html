                A college project where I had to come up with a new app idea for tourists visiting to Oslo,
                based entirely on needs I discovered through user interviews.
                The design presented here represents the third iteration of the project. As such, the timeframe between
                initial user resarch to present prototype is much longer than normal for such projects, but at the same time this means that the following presentation serves well in
                terms of showing my learning curve for the past 18 months.

                I received the Oslo tourism app brief in August 2020, a time when Oslo was effectively closed to foreign
                tourists and access to sites of interest was significantly restricted due to pandemic guidelines.
                <br>
                This left me with two possible directions. I could base the concept on userâ€™s experiences before the
                pandemic, with a view to make an app that would become valid again a soon as restrictions lifted. Or I
                could confine my research to the challenges of present moment and hope that this extreme situation
                would create unique insights that could prove useful also when the pandemic restrictions lifted.

        <div class="case2__concept-text__paragraph-2">
            <p>
                I chose the latter, i.e. to make it a â€˜domestic tourist during a pandemicâ€™ project, and set about interviewing
                friends, family and colleagues based in Oslo, asking them about their current urban leisure options. During the
                pandemic this was essentially confined to going for walks or to hang out in open spaces such as parks
                and public squares. (Oslo never had a full curfew).
        
                During this reseach I discovered several sources of frustration across different demographics, but most
                interestingly I found that parents of young children could spend quite a bit of time searching for suitable 
                playgrounds.

                Starting with a rather wide demographic I narrowed down my project by basing the app on the
                subgroup whose most strongly felt need was currently the least served by what's available.

                The first two iterations were user tested with the Adobe XD app, but by the third iteration the Figma
                Mirror app had improved to the point where it could support impromptu user testing using a phone only.

                When I arrived at the third iteration of this project I discareded all prevoius resarch and started anew
                by finding colour combinations using the Adobe Color tool. I then tested these with an incredibly
                useful heuristic I learned from the colours.cafe Instagram account where a palette is evaluated by
                applying it to generic vector images and also made into gradient swatches.
                <br>
                Finally, I used the Materialize color tool to explore more user friendly shades of the palette in
                question.

                I learned that picking a colour palette for an app is a choice that far exceeds personal preferences.
                Taking a step away from the app UI and testing the palettes in a separate workspace proved useful.
