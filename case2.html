                A college project where I had to come up with a new idea for an app meant for tourists visiting Oslo,
                based entirely on needs I discovered through user interviews.
                The design presented here represents the third iteration of the project. As such, the timeframe from
                initial user resarch to present prototype is longer than normal for such projects, but at the same
                time this means that the following presentation works well in terms of showing my learning curve for the
                past 18 months.

            <p>
                I received the Oslo tourism app brief in August 2020, a time when Oslo was effectively closed to foreign
                tourists and access to sites of interest was significantly restricted due to pandemic guidelines.
                <br>
                This left me with two possible directions. I could base the concept on userâ€™s experiences before the
                pandemic, with a view to make an app that would become valid again a soon as restrictions lifted. Or I
                could confine my research to the challenges of present moment and hope that this extreme situation
                would create unique insights that could prove useful also when the pandemic restrictions lifted.

        <div class="case2__survey-text__paragraph-2">
            <p>
                I chose the latter, i.e. to make it a â€˜domestic tourist during a pandemicâ€™ project, and set about
                interviewing
                friends, family and colleagues based in Oslo, asking them about their current urban leisure options.
                During the
                pandemic this was essentially confined to going for walks or to hang out in open spaces such as parks
                and public squares. (Oslo never had a full curfew).

                During this reseach I discovered several sources of frustration across different demographics, but most
                interestingly I found that parents of young children could spend quite a bit of time searching for
                suitable
                playgrounds.

                Starting with a rather wide demographic I narrowed down my project by basing the app on the

                Following the interview stage, the project moved to a pen and paper stage. The first set of drawings
                were rather crude sketches of the appâ€™s main screens. These were then loaded into the <a
                    href="https://marvelapp.com/">Marvel app</a> for
                testing, allowing me to work out the most basic information flows and seek out immediate user feedback.
                <br><br>
                For the second and third iterations of the project I moved the sketching routine to dot paper and took
                care to consider the full length of the scrollable app screen.

                The most useful user feedback was found in the lo-fi wireframe phase. The rather clinical visual
                language produced the most direct responses regarding priorities and trigger points.

            <p>
                The lo-fi wireframe stage was tricky in the sense that the concept and sketching phases had uncovered an
                abundance of ideas for what the app could be. So this intermediary stage presented some harder decisions
                in terms of what categories of information would be given priority, what should be cut out, and in what
                order the the information ought to be presented.

                The first two iterations were user tested with the Adobe XD app, but by the third iteration the Figma

                situations. The user flow chart was where I had to determine how the user would become familiar with

                possibilities in the first place.

            <p>
                My first few iterations were quick and straightforward, where the app would open directly in map
                view allowing the user to immediately see which playgrounds were within walking distance from their
                present
                location. However, most tourism and sightseeing apps are based on a central core of editorialised
                content, allowing the user to plan their itineraries well in advance. Later iterations therefore
                explored the
                scope of what this content could be and which categories would be helpful to the target demographic.
                <br><br>
                That being said, a richer experience can mean that the user will take longer to become familiar with the
                app. The present iteration is an attempt to find a balance between facilitating quick decisions
                for busy parents, yet providing enough avenues of information to leave the user satisfied.

                When working on the mid-fi wireframes I started using real data, while also playing around with various
                layouts and stylistic directions I had been wanting to try out. This introduced discipline to the
                process. The need to convey information about real playgrounds would regularly present
                challenges to my design ideas, compelling me to quickly throw out any sources of inspiration that could
                not be applied in
                practice.
                <br> <br>
                Then followed a more intensive phase as I developed the feedback from the mid-fi wireframes into a hi-fi
                prototype with all relevant screens and functionality. Running frequent iterations, I tested the app on
                an ongoing basis with just a couple of dedicated users.
