                A college project where I had to come up with a new idea for an app meant for tourists visiting Oslo,
                based entirely on needs I discovered through user interviews.
                The design presented here represents the third iteration of the project. As such, the timeframe from
                initial user resarch to present prototype is longer than normal for such projects, but at the same
                time this means that the following presentation works well in terms of showing my learning curve for the
                past 18 months.

                I received the Oslo tourism app brief in August 2020, a time when Oslo was effectively closed to foreign
                tourists and access to sites of interest was significantly restricted due to pandemic guidelines.
                <br>
                This left me with two possible directions. I could base the concept on userâ€™s experiences before the
                pandemic, with a view to make an app that would become valid again a soon as restrictions lifted. Or I
                could confine my research to the challenges of present moment and hope that this extreme situation
                would create unique insights that could prove useful also when the pandemic restrictions lifted.

        <div class="case2__survey-text__paragraph-2">
            <p>
                I chose the latter, i.e. to make it a â€˜domestic tourist during a pandemicâ€™ project, and set about
                interviewing
                friends, family and colleagues based in Oslo, asking them about their current urban leisure options.
                During the
                pandemic this was essentially confined to going for walks or to hang out in open spaces such as parks
                and public squares. (Oslo never had a full curfew).

                During this reseach I discovered several sources of frustration across different demographics, but most
                interestingly I found that parents of young children could spend quite a bit of time searching for
                suitable
                playgrounds.

                Starting with a rather wide demographic I narrowed down my project by basing the app on the

                Following the interview stage, the project moved to a pen and paper stage. The first set of drawings
                were rather crude sketches of the appâ€™s main screens. These were then loaded into the <a href="https://marvelapp.com/">Marvel app</a> for
                testing, allowing me to work out the most basic information flows and seek out immediate user feedback.
                <br><br>
                For the second and third iterations of the project I moved the sketching routine to dot paper and took
                care to consider the full length of the scrollable app screen.

                The most useful user feedback was found in the lo-fi wireframe phase. The rather clinical visual

                The lo-fi wireframe stage was tricky in the sense that the concept and sketching phases had uncovered an
                abundance of ideas for what the app could be. So this intermediary stage presented some harder decisions
                in terms of what categories of information would be given priority, what should be cut out, and in what
                order the the information ought to be presented.

                The first two iterations were user tested with the Adobe XD app, but by the third iteration the Figma

                The initial phases of the project had explored all the ways in which the app could respond to particular
                needs
                and
                situations. The user flow chart was where I had to determine how the user would become familiar with
                these
                possibilities in the first place.

                My first few iterations were quick and straightforward apps where the app would open directly in map
                view, allowing the user to see which playgrounds were in immediate walking distance from their present
                location. However, most tourism and sightseeing apps are based on a central core of editorialised
                content, allowing the user to plan their visits well in advance. Later iterations therefore explored the
                scope of what this content could be and which categories would be helpful to the target demographic.
                <br><br>
                However, a richer experience can mean the user will take longer to become familiar with the app. The
                present iteration of the flowchart is an attempt to find a balance between facilitating quick decisions
                for busy parents on the move yet providing enough levers of information to leave the user satisfied.

                When working on the mid-fi wireframes I started using real data, while also playing around with various
                layouts and stylistic directions I had been wanting to try out. This introduced discipline to the
                process. The need to convey information about real playgrounds would regularly present immediate
                challenges to my design ideas, compelling me to quickly throw out any sources of inspiration that could
                not be applied in
                practice.
                <br> <br>
                I initiated another round of user testing to help me determine which style, as well as which layouts,
                would be most appreciated by the target group.

                As the mid-fi design started coming together I entered a more intensive phase with frequent iterations tested on an ongoing basis with just a couple of users. Whilst working towards a comprehensive protype, with all relevant screens and functions, I found myself making the design increasingly minimal.
